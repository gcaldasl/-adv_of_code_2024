The first time I feel confident enough to face this yearly challenge, even though I might not give the most optimized solutions out there.

Day one: took me 50 minutes.

Day two: part one took me 1h30, part two took me 10 minutes. A lot of time because I tried to achieve a better solution, but only got the bad solution in the end.
